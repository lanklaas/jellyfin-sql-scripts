# What is this?

A repo with sql scripts that I use to maintain my jellyfin. Currently only 2.

# General

I do not see me adding much more than the 2 scripts as I have not needed more, but feel free to send a PR to add your own.

I use the scripts in combination with [dotnet repl](https://github.com/jonsequitur/dotnet-repl) (for displaying ticks) and [sqlite browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) for attaching the second db and running the scripts.

The scripts has comments in the files to explain what they are for. I mostly use it to check when a user is done with a large series so I can free up some disk space.
